# Methodology

The sentiment analyses mainly involved firstly preparing the date importing text files, cleaning the data and re-arranging it into suitable formats. The second step was to a) choosing dictionary as basis for the sentiment analyses and b) re-arranging the output data so that it Tableau could understand it. 

I'll explain here more about the details of the project, so text/ sentiment analysis, the dictionaries I used etc. But bascially I wanted to see how far one can use the standard dictionaries within R (NRC, Bing, AFINN & SentimentR) to analyse content (in this case books) and in how far the results differ.

I'll also provide the link to the github repo (first I need to clean up the code though)
