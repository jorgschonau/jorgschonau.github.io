# Sentiment Analysis 
### aka Crime & Sentiment

For my final project at [Ubiqum Code Academy](https://www.ubiqum.com/courses/data-analyst-big-data-berlin/) I analysed a number of classic literature books with the aim of visualizing the content, or rather the sentiments (or the mood/ feelings if you will) associated with the text. The books I used for this analysis:

- [1984 by George Orwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four)
- [Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_and_Punishment)
- [Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_and_the_Chocolate_Factory)
- [Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy)

I choose two books with a rather upbeat vibe and two books on the rather sombre end of the spectrum (as you probably can already tell by titles). Mainly because I wanted to see how sentiment packages score the content of each book.

You'll find a number of visualisations based on the output data under the links further below.

## The Project

Sentiment analyses is one of the standard methods for analysing any kinds of texts with R. Typical applications for text analysis are for example analysing tweets, evaluating user reviews (e.g. on Amazon) or gathering what newspapers are saying on specific topics.

I'll explain here more about the details of the project, the dictionaries I used etc. But bascially I wanted to see how far one can use the standard dictionaries within R (NRC, Bing, AFINN & SentimentR) to analyse content (in this case a number of well known books) and in how far the results differ.

## Visualisations

Producing visualisations with Tableau made up a considerable part of the project, so without further ado, here they are:
