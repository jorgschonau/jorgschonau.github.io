# Sentiment Analysis

For my final project at Ubiqum Code Academy I analysed a number of classic literrature books namely:

- 1984 by George Orwell
- Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky
- Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl 
- Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams

I then visualized the results with Tableau. You'll find the link for some examples further below.

## The Project

I'll explain here more about the project, so text analysis, the dictionaries I used etc.

But bascially I wanted to see how far you can use standard dictionaries within R (NRC, Bing, AFINN & SentimentR) to analyse books and how the results differ.

In the ned I decided to use the NRC dictionary. Mostly because it is the most extensive one and seemed to produce some good insights. Also the sentence based package SentimentR produced some good results, some analyses showed surprising similarities with the ones generated with NRC. At a later stage I might compare both in more details (provided that I will ever have enough time at my hands). 

## Visualisations

The main part of the project was actually producing visulisations using Tableau, so without further ado, here they are:
