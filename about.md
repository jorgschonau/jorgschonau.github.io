# About me

I'll put here more info about my good self. One thing you might have not known about me is that I once translated the German subtitles for a TED talk about "The kinky sex live of insects", you'll find the video [here](https://www.ted.com/talks/marlene_zuk_what_we_learn_from_insects_kinky_sex_lives/transcript).

Other than that, my [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joergschoenau/) will have to suffice for the time being.
